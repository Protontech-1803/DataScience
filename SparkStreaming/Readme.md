In this POC, a movie rating data set is analyzed using Spark. As a result of analysis, the count of star ratings that are given by various users for a given movie is displayed.

**Below are the steps to load and filter the dataset with respect to a movie rating:**
**Note:** The Movie is Rated between the range [1-5] stars in the dataset.

1.	Consider a Movie Rating Data Set in the file. For example, ml-100k.zip.
2.	Extract the file and move the file to the respective folder.
3.	Launch Eclipse IDE and create a new Spark Scala Project. Add the below code in the IDE, where the **countby** operation gives the count of star rating given by the users for a given movie data set.
